<h2>✨ Trading the way it was meant to be</h2>

- **No-code Strategy builder**: industry-standard indicators (EMA, RSI, MACD, Stochastic and more), math, logic, converters
- **Export real MQL5 code** and run it inside **MetaTrader 5**
- **Advanced backtesting** on-device with historical Forex data
- **Professional metrics & reports**: win rate, expectancy, drawdown, profit factor and more
- **Mobile-first**: builder + backtester right on your phone
- **Strategy templates out of the box** (RSI Overbought/Oversold, EMA Crossover, Stochastic trend detection, Multi-indicator confirmation)

<h3>This is the public repository for Forex Strategy Studio, where we publish:</h3>

- **Sample exported MQL5 strategies** (Expert Advisors) created in the app in the no-code builder
- **Forex AI agent** with REST API, plus MQL5 bridge utilities to call the agent from MetaTrader 5 EAs
- **MetaTrader MCP/API server** (used by the Forex AI Agent)
- **MQL5 utilities** (helpers, templates, HTTP/JSON glue)
- **Python/Node.js utilities**

Use the Forex Strategy Studio Android app to build strategies without coding, then use the resources in this GitHub to help you take it further: integrate, extend, automate, and deploy cleanly.
